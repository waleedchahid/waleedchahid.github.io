        <h1>Harira - Lentil and Chickpea Soup</h1>

        <!-- Insert Harira image here -->

  <p>Harira is a beloved Moroccan soup often served during Ramadan to brea 
  fast. Itâ€™s hearty, full of protein, and tastes amazing. It has always been 
  one of my favorite foods growing up, and still currently.</p>
