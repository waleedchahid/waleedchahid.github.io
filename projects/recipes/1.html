        <h1>Morrocan Couscous</h1>

        <!-- insert image here -->

        <p>Moroccan couscous is a dish that brings our family together on 
        special occasions. It’s colorful, comforting, and full of spices that 
        fill the house with warmth. We learned this recipe from my grandmother, 
        who always said that the secret is in the slow steaming of the 
        couscous and the rich vegetable broth.</p>

        <blockquote>"A family that eats couscous together stays together."
        -Mom</blockquote>

        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Steam the couscous instead of boiling it for a fluffy texture.</li>
    <li>Add a drizzle of olive oil between steamings to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li>Use seasonal vegetables for the best flavor and color.</li>
  </ul>
