Client Website Project – Process Documentation
Client Information
Client: Independent Music Artist (Music Portfolio)
The client is an independent artist who wanted a simple, professional website to showcase their music and artistic identity. The site is intended to function as a portfolio that can be shared with listeners, collaborators, and potential booking contacts.

Phase 1: Discovery & Planning
Initial Client Interview
Method: In-person conversation
What was discussed:
Purpose of the website (music portfolio and online presence)
Target audience (listeners, fans, collaborators, and industry contacts)
Must-have content (artist bio, links to music, contact information)
Visual style preferences
Client feedback:
Wanted a clean and minimal layout that feels professional
Preferred neutral, calm colors rather than bright or aggressive ones
Wanted the website to feel like an extension of their music style
Decisions made:
Website will focus on clarity and simplicity
Navigation will include Home, Music, About, and Contact pages
Placeholder text and images will be used until final content is provided

Design Mockup
A basic layout mockup was created before writing any code. The mockup included:
Header with artist name and navigation bar
Main content area with featured music or bio content
Footer with copyright information
UI elements included:
Header
Navigation menu
Main content sections
Footer
The mockup was shared with the client to confirm structure and layout before development began.

Phase 2: Iterative Development
Check-in #1 – Design Feedback
Method: In-person
What was shown:
Website layout mockup
Client feedback:
“I like the simple layout. I want it to feel calm and neutral.”
Agreed changes:
Use a beige and white color palette
Avoid clutter and keep spacing generous

Check-in #2 – Working Website Review
Method: In-person
What was shown:
Fully working HTML website with navigation
Home, Music, About, and Contact pages
Beige and white color scheme applied
Client feedback:
“The colors fit the vibe I was going for.”
“I like that it’s simple and easy to use.”
Agreed changes:
Keep the beige and white theme
Use external Spotify links instead of embedded players
Leave space for future images and album artwork

Phase 3: Final Delivery
The final website was completed and shared with the client using GitHub Pages. The client was shown:
How the site files are organized
Where images and text can be updated
How Spotify links are included
Future plans:
Client may add images and update song lists later
Client understands they can copy the code to their own GitHub account if needed

Reflection
This project followed an agile development process with multiple check-ins and revisions based on client feedback. Design choices, including color palette and layout, were driven by the client’s artistic goals while maintaining accessibility and clean, semantic HTML/CSS.
