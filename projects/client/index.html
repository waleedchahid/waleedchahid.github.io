      <h2>Welcome to My Music Portfolio</h2>
      <p>What got me into music?

I’ve been singing all my life, I was a very talkative kid so learning how to sing made my voice more pleasing to hear.

Why did I start taking it serious?

One of my friends actually showed me a song of his and it made me realize I could do the same thing if I put my mind to it, and it started from there.

What is my goal for music?

I don’t really have a goal for music, I just want to make art that can inspire others and that people can relate to.</p>
