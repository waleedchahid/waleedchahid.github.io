    <h1>Sep 19 Classwork: Terminal</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Today, we will be learning about how to use the terminal. the terminal
    is a very useful tool built right into every computer. However, if you
    dont know how to use it, then it is just a black screen with some random
    words and symbols on it.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How to use the Terminal</h2>
    <p>In order to use the terminal, you need to know some commands.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cd is used to move to a new folder. For example, if I am in at ~
        (home directory) and type <code>cd Desktop/</code>, I will now be in
        the Desktop folder.</li>
        <li>ls is used to look around. If I am still in the Desktop folder from
        when we used cd, and type <code>ls</code>, I can see everything on my
        desktop.</li>
        <li>Now that we are in Desktop and can see what is in it, we can start
        deleting stuff. To delete something, do <code>rm filename</code>. Poof.
        Now its gone.</li>
        <li>To make a new directory (the terminal calls folders directories) we
        do <code>mkdir directoryname</code>. Now you have a new folder called
        directoryname.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the basic commands, but they should allow you to move around, and not feel totaly lost.</p>
<br>
<h2>Vim</h2>
<p>Vim is how we edit files. It is a seperate branch of the terminal, and is
the single most usefull tool you can have. unfortumately, it can get pretty
annoying if you dont know what you are doing. Here are the steps you will have
to do in order to make your first file using vim.</p>
<ol>
    <li>To create a file named thingamabob.html, type <code>vim
    thingamabob.htm</code>. You should now be in a weird black screen with a bunch of
    brakets. This is vim.</li>
    <li>To actually write something in vim, you need to press <kbd>i</kbd> or
    <kbd>o</kbd>. Now you can write whatever you want.</li>
    <li>To leave vim, press <kbd>esc</kbd> and type <kbd>:wq</kbd>. The : tells vim that you are
    about to write a command, and w saves what you wrote, and q quits vim.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This concludes a very basic, very brief introduction to the terminal and
    vim. If you want to learn more about the terminal, there is a game called
    terminus that explains it very well. And if you want to learn more about
    vim, go into the terminal and write <code>vimtutor</code>. this opens a vim
    tutorial that takes around 30 minutes to finish.</p>
